# Build document
* CMakeLists.txt
  - like Makefile
* add_executable(`<name>` source1 [source2 ...])
  - Adds an executable target called `<name>` to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.
  - The `<name>` corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.
```
# single source file
add_executable(stest single_list.cpp)

# multiple source files
add_executable(main
    create1.cpp
    create2.cpp
    create3.cpp
)
```

# Build a single file
* a single source file is going to be built into an executable binary
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

add_executable(stest single_list.cpp)
```

# Build multiple files in sub directory
* serveral files in different sub direcotries, build them all in the root directory, and also could build each in a sub directory.
```
