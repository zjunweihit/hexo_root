# Lecture 4

For today's discussion, we'll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments. Now you had to read two animal specials, the Eastern marmot and Olympic marmot.
Marmots are `rodents`. They are large ground `squirrel` about the size of an average of horse cat. And they live in a variety of habits.
And even though they spend a significant portion of the year hibernating, according to this case study marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral study. Why is that?
Well when they are not hibernating, you can find them in open areas and they are pretty avtive during the day, which makes them easy to observe, right?
Uh-ha? So first let's discuss the Eastern marmots. They reside throughout the east regon of North America, where there is temperate climate, where the growing season lasts at least five months of thej year, which is when they do all their mating, playing and eating.
Oh I see, at first I wans't sure what the growing season meant, just from reading, but now I get it. It's the amount of time it takes for them to grow, right? So it would be five months?
Emmm, I'm sorry, but no. It is nothing to do with that. It's not about the time it takes Easten marmots to grow. It's when the food available. That is when it's not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass, and umm, vegetative parts of a plant's herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat.
So growing season refers to the availability of the food they eat, OK? So now, how would you describe the Easten marmots' the social habits?
Well, they are really `territorial`, and loners, and just so `aggressive`, even with other Easten marmots. And their mating ritual is just so `impersonal`.
Ah-ha, now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation, the mating process begins.
For them, well, they come together to mate and then they go their separate ways. Then about six to eight weeks after birth, the `offspring` leave their mothers.
Really? Just six weeks? Is it possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young?
Well, it's not `as if` they aren't ready for the real world because they are.
Remember they mature quickly and the weather's nice. Alos they live in open fild where there is lots of `edible` `vegetation`.
So roughly six weeks after birth, Easten marmots are just so old enough to take chances of surviving in `temperate` environment.
So how does this relate to their behavior?
Oh, I get it. Since the climate's not too bad, Eaten marmots don't have to rely on each other too much, and they really don't need to stay together as a family to survive either.
Uh-ha, any `contrast`, Olympic marmots? what about them?
Well, they live together as a falimy and they take care of their young until they are at least two years old. They're really friendly with each other. And what I really like is that they even have greeting `ceremonies`.
And they are `not at all` aggressive and territorial like the Easten marmots. So they social behavior is so different from Eaten marmots because of the climates where they live?
That seems so bizarre.
Well, the Olympic marmots `inhabit` `meadows` high Olympic Montains where the weather conditions are much harsher. So there is a lot of wind and snow.
The growing season only lasts two to three months. So in that much shorter period of time all the Olympic marmots male and female, eat, play and `nurture` the young together.
Because the climate is so harsh, cooperation inscreases the survival rate of Olympic marmots.
They keep their young at home untill they are physically able to survive on their own.
That could explain why the social behavior of Olympic marmots is so unlike that of the Easten marmots.
