# Get the output in column major

For compatibility BLAS keeps the column major style as matrix stroage as same as FORTRAN.
It's a different from C/C++ programming, which is row major matrix.

* e.g. `C = alpha * A * B + beta * C` as `C = A * B`, alpha= 1.0fï¼Œbeta = 0.0f.
```
Prepare data A, B in column major and fixed shape as below:
A (m x k) * B (k x n) = C (m x n)
   2 x 3       3 x 2       2 x 2

             da, lda,
             db, ldb,
             &beta,
             dc, ldc)

orignal B (n x k): 2 x 3 => BT (k x n)

| 6 4 2 | T  | 6 5 |
| 5 3 1 | => | 4 3 | in sgemm for matrix multiplication
             | 2 1 |

```

Leading Dimension:
  * The first index in the dimension. A(20, 10), lda=20, row number.
  * If we set `HIPBLAS_OP_T`, it will be the column number, otherwise, it's row number.
  * The number of items in next line at the same position as the current line in matrix order(row major or column major)
