# Conversaton 2
* Did you register already for your classes next semester.
- Yes, I did.
* What are you taking?
- Um... `contemporary` literature. English style. Um... a teaching `seminar`, and I still have to do my students teaching. I'm gonna help teach a writting class of the junior high.
* That's a heavy schedule.
- Yeah, it will be really busy and I'm also taking a theory class. But I have to quit my job a couple of weeks cause it will be just too much.
* Where do you work at?
- Buster's coffee shop, but just till the end of the month.
- What are you doing next semester?
* Actually a teaching seminar too. And I have to start writting my `thesis`. You know, I'm also `going for` my master degree.
- So you are not writting any `poetry`, I imagine.
