# Conversaton 2
* Did you register already for your classes next semester.
- Yes, I did.
* What are you taking?
- Um... `contemporary` literature. English style. Um... a teaching `seminar`, and I still have to do my students teaching. I'm gonna help teach a writting class of the junior high.
* That's a heavy schedule.
- Yeah, it will be really busy and I'm also taking a theory class. But I have to quit my job a couple of weeks cause it will be just too much.
* Where do you work at?
- Buster's coffee shop, but just till the end of the month.
- What are you doing next semester?
* Actually a teaching seminar too. And I have to start writting my `thesis`. You know, I'm also `going for` my master degree.
- So you are not writting any `poetry`, I imagine.
* No, I was just thinking about revising some of my poems, sending them into places for publication.
- Cool, you should. Um, did you hear about that new poetry club, The Poetry Kitchen?
* Yeah, no time.
- It's fun, it's Sunday night. You don't do anything at Sunday nights?
* I do homework Sunday nights.
- Well, it's only from 7 to 9.
* Is it every Sunday?
- Last Sunday every month. I don't know aobut this month, cause it's problely a little close to the Thanksgiving. So they might move it up. I don't know what they are gonna to do. But it's a good time, it's fun, some really impressive readings.
* Who? From our class?
- Some people from our class are reading. A lot of them go, sometimes even professor.
* Really? I don't know if I would read in front of her.
- You don't have to read, you can just watch. I just watched the first time. But it's good environment to read them, I think anyway.
* I probably have to write something new, so maybe during the summer, I just can't now.
- Yeah, it wouldn't be the same just reading old stuff. Are you going to do summer school?
* Definitely. Otherwise, I will be short 6 credits, I have no choice.
- Yeah, me too. This is the second summer I'll have to take classes. I gotta go now, my Shakespeare class starts at twenty minutes.
