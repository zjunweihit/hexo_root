# Lecture 1
* OK, I'm going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that `at some point` during this semester I want you to attend an `exhibit` at the Fairy Streat Gallary and then write about it? Well the exhibit I wnat you to attend is `coming up`. It's already started in fact, but it'll be at the gallary for the next month, which should give you `plenty of time` to complete this assignment. The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen.
* Frantzen's work may be unfamilar to you, since she's a raltively young artist. But she got a very unusual style, `compared to` some of artists we've looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen's style is what she herself calls Realistic and Impressionism. So you've probably studied both of these movements, separately, seprate movements, "Realism and Impressionism", in some of your art history courses.
* So who can just sum these up?
- Well, Impressionism started in late 19th `century`. Um, the basic impressionist style is very different from earlier styles. It didn't `depict` the `scenes` or models exactly as they look.
- Impressionist painters `attend to` `apply paint` really `thickly` and big `brushstroke`, so the texture of `canvas` was rough.
* Good, what else? What were the subject?
- Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday seeings, like people on the streat and in cafes, and lots of nature scences, especially `landscapes`.
* Good, so when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close at a certain painting.
* It's a farm scene. And you'll see it right as you enter the gallary. The reason I think this paiting is so important is that it `stresses` impressionist `aspect of` Frantzen's style. It's a outdoor scene, and everyday scene. It's kind of `bleak`, which you can really see those `broad brushstroke` and `blurry` lines. The color aren't quit realistic. The sky is kind of, well, in a natural pinkish yellow. And the fence in the `foreground` is blue, but somehow, the overall scene gives an imprssion of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that's the impressionist side of her work.
* Oh, and speaking about the farm that reminds me. One intersting thing I read about the Frantzen is when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn. And the Sales Barn was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals.
* And the reason of Frantzen went there and she `later on` would visite other places, like `dance hall`, was to observe people and the ways that they moved. She really found this helped her work, that it gave her an nderstanding of body movement and actions, how humans move and `stand still`, `what their postures were like, too`.
* So what about Realism? What are `the elements` of Realism  we should be looking for in Frantzen's work?
- Um, real honests depiction of subject matter, pretty `unidealized(unideal?) stuff`, and pretty everyday subject matter too.
* Good. One other painting I really want you to look at `is of` a young woman surrounded by `pumpkins`. You will notice the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph. The woman's nose is a little `less than perfect` and her hair is kind of messed up. This is Realism. But then, the background of the painting, this woman with pumpkins is wrapped with a `blanket` of broad thick brushstroke, and it's all kinds of `zigzagging` brushstrokes, lines, kind of `chaotic` almost when you look at close. And they are `vibrant colors`.
* There's lots of orange, with little hints of an `electic blue` `peeking out`. I find Frantzen to be a very `accessible artist`.
* I mean, some artists to aprieciate them, you have to know their life story. But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen's life anyway. She attened the art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at `illustration` and she should go into advertising instead. So she took the advertising art classed and `fined` the art class too, until she `convinced by` the head of advertising agency that work was really good, and she could be a artist.
* But of course that is not easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people `portraits` at place like `art fair`, just make money to buy paint for her more series of art works. `No matter what`, she never stop paining. And now Frantzen is doing `extremely` well, And her work is being shown all over the country.
* So I think most of us would be `discouraged` if we have to face challeges and difficulties like that. But what's important is you `keep at it` that you don't give up. That's what is really important to remember.
