# Lecture 1
* OK, I'm going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that `at some point` during this semester I want you to attend an `exhibit` at the Fairy Streat Gallary and then write about it? Well the exhibit I wnat you to attend is `coming up`. It's already started in fact, but it'll be at the gallary for the next month, which should give you `plenty of time` to complete this assignment. The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen.
* Frantzen's work may be unfamilar to you, since she's a raltively young artist. But she got a very unusual style, `compared to` some of artists we've looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen's style is what she herself calls Realistic and Impressionism. So you've probably studied both of these movements, separately, seprate movements, "Realism and Impressionism", in some of your art history courses.
* So who can just sum these up?
- Well, Impressionism started in late 19th `century`. Um, the basic impressionist style is very different from earlier styles. It didn't `depict` the `scenes` or models exactly as they look.
- Impressionist painters `attend to` `apply paint` really `thickly` and big `brushstroke`, so the texture of `canvas` was rough.
