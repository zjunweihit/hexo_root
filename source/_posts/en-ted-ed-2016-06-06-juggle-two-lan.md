How interpreters juggle two languages at once

# How interpreters juggle two languages at once

In 1956, during the `diplomatic reception` in Moscow, Soviet leader `Nikita Khrushchev` told `Western Bloc` `ambassadors`.
"My vas pokhoronim!" His interpreter rendered that into English as "We will `bury` you!"
This statement sent `shokewaves` through the western world, `hightening` the tension between the Soviet Union and the US, who were `in the thick of` the Cold War.
Some believe this incident alone set the East/West relations back a `decade`. `As it turns out`, Khrushchev's remark is translated a bit too literally. `Given` the context, his words should be rendered as "we will live to see you buried" meaning that the Communism would `outlast` Capitalism, a less threatening comment.
Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's `apparent` words put the world on the path that could have led to the nuclear `armageddon`.
So now, given the complexity of languange and cultural exchange, how does this `sort of` thing not happen `all the time`? Much of the answer `lies with` the skill and training of interpreters to `overcome` the language barrier. For most of history, interpretion was mainly done `consecutively`, with speakers and interpreters `making pauses` to allow each other to speek. But after `the advent of` radio technology, a new `simultaneous interpretation` system was developed `in the wake of` Wold War two.
In the simultaneous mode, the interpreters `instantaneously` translate the speaker's words into a microphone while he speaks. Without pauses, those in the audience can choose language in which they want to follow. On the surface it all looks `seamless`, but behand the scenes, human interpreters work `incessantly` to ensure every idear `gets across` `as intended`.
And that is no easy task. It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilangual professionals who expand their vacabulary and master the skills necessary to become a conference interpreter. To `get used to` the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers and repeat every word exactly as heard in the same language.
In time they begin to paraphase what is said, making `stylistic` adjustments as they go. `At some point`, a second language is introduced.
Practicing in this way creates new `neural` `pathways` in interpreter's brain, and the `constant effort` of `reformulation` `gradually` becomes second nature.
`Over time` and through much hard work, the interperer master a `vast` array of tricks to `keep up with` spead, deal with challenging `terminology` and handle `a multitude of` foreigen `accents`.
They may `resort to` `acronyms` to shorten the long name, choose generic terms over specific, or refer to slide and other visual aside. They can even leave a term in original language, while they search the most `accurate` `equivalent`.
The interperters are also `skilled at` keeping `aplomb` `in the face of` chaos. Remember they have no control of who is going to say what, or how `articulate` the speaker will sound. A curveball can be thrown at any time. Also they offen perform to thousands of people, and did in very `intimidating` settings, like UN General Assembly.
To keep their emotions `in check`, they carefully prepare for an assignment. Building the `glossaries` in advance, reading voraciously about the subject matter and reviewing the previous talk on the topic. Finally the interperters work in pairs. While one colleage is busy tranlating incoming speeches in a real time, the other gives support by locating documents, looking up words, and `tracking down` pertinent information.
Because simultaneous interpretation requires intense concertration, every thirty minutes the pair switch the roles. Success is heavly dependent on skillful collabration.
Language is complex, and when abstract or `nuanced` concepts get lost in tralation, the consequence may be `catastrophic`.
As Margare Atwood famously noted "War is what happens when language fails." Conference interpreters of all people are aware that and work diligently behind the scenes to make sure it never does.
