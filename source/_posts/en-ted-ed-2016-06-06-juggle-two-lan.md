In 1956, during the `diplomatic reception` in Moscow, Soviet leader `Nikita Khrushchev` told `Western Bloc` `ambassadors`.
"My vas pokhoronim!" His interpreter rendered that into English as "We will `bury` you!"
This statement sent `shokewaves` through the western world, `hightening` the tension between the Soviet Union and the US, who were `in the thick of` the Cold War.
Some believe this incident alone set the East/West relations back a `decade`. As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark is translated a bit too literally. `Given` the context, his words should be rendered as "we will live to see you buried" meaning that the Communism would `outlast` Capitalism, a less threatening comment.
Though the intended meaning was clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's `apparent` words put the world on the path that could have led to the nuclear `armageddon`.
So now, given the complexity of languange and cultural exchange, how does this `sort of` thing not happen `all the time`? Much of the answer `lies with` the skill and training of interpreters to `overcome` the language barrier. For most of history, interpretion was mainly done `consecutively`, with speakers and interpreters `making pauses` to allow each other to speek. But after `the advent of` radio technology, a new `simultaneous interpretation` system was developed `in the wake of` Wold War two.
In the simultaneous mode, the interpreters `instantaneously` translate the speaker's words into a microphone while he speaks. Without pauses, those in the audience can choose language in which they want to follow. On the surface it all looks `seamless`, but behand the scenes, human interpreters work `incessantly` to ensure every idear `gets across` `as intended`.
