# Lecture 1

Ok, let's get started. Greate, today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determ how old a piece of land and some other geology feature is - dating techniques. I'm goting to talk about a particular dating technique.

Why? Good dating is key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how land formation was formed, the first thing you problably want to know is how old it is. It's fundamental. Um, take the Grant Canyon for instance.

Now, we geologist thought we had pretty good idear of how the `Grant Canyon` in Southwest of United States were formed. We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidafied somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago. Before it solidated, it was just regular sand. `Essentially` it was part of vast desert.

And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient moutain range `fairly` close by that `flattened` over time.
That's been the `conventional wisdom` among geologists for quite some time.
But now we've learned something different and quite surprising using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating. I should say the Uranium-Lead Dating has `been around` `for quite a while`.
But there have been some recent refinements. I will get into this in a minute.

Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. Two geologist discovered that about half of sand from Grant Canyon was actually `once` part of Appalachian Mountains.
That's really eye-opening news, since the Appalachian Mountains Range is, of course, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grant Canyon. Sounds pretty unbelievable, right?
Of course, the obvious question is how does that sand `end up` so far west? The theory is the huge rivers and wind carried the sand west, where it `mixed in with` the sand already there.
Well this is pretty revolutionary finding. Um and it basically was because of Uranium-Lead Dating.
Why? As everyone in this class should know we usually look at the `grain type` within the sandtone, meaning the actual `particles` in the sandstone, to determine where it came from.
You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the grain to their location and figure out which way is flowing.
But that's only useful `up to a point`, and that was not what these two geologists did. Uranium-Lead Dating allows them to `go about it` an `entirely different` way.
What they did was they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon was a material that contains `radioactive` Urandim which is very usefule for dating purposes.
Zircon starts off as `molten magma`, the hot `larva` from `volcanoes`. This magma then crystallizes. And when the Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead. So if you meature the amount of Lead in the Zircon grain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges.
Once you do that, you can compaire the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to(with?) the age of the Zircon from the mountains.
If the age of Zircon matches the age of one of your mountains that means the sandstone actually used to be a part of that particular mountain ranges.
Is everybody with me on that? Good!
