# Lecture 1
Ok, let's get started. Greate, today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determ how old a piece of land and some other geology feature is - dating techniques. I'm goting to talk about a particular dating technique.

Why? Good dating is key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how land formation was formed, the first thing you problably want to know is how old it is. It's fundamental. Um, take the Grant Canyon for instance.

Now, we geologist thought we had pretty good idear of how the `Grant Canyon` in Southwest of United States were formed. We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidafied somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago. Before it solidated, it was just regular sand. `Essentially` it was part of vast desert.

And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient moutain range `fairly` close by that `falttened` over time.
That's been the `conventional` wisdom geologists for quite some time.
