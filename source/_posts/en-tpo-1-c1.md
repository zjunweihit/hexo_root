# Conversation 1

* Hi, um... I really hope you can help me.
- That's why I'm here. What can I do for you.
* `I'm supposed to do` a literature review for my psychology course, but I'm `haveing a hard time` finding article. I don't even know where to start looking.
- You said it's for your psychology couse, right? So your focus is on...
* Dream Interpretation
- Well, you have a focus. That's already a good start. Hmm... There are a few things... Oh wait, have you checked to see if your professor put on any material for you to look at `on reserve`?
* Aha, that's one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals.
- Let's get you going on to look for those then. We have printed version of twenty or so(?) psychology journals on Reference Section. These are the ones published within the last year. Then I think about it, the journal named Sleep and Dream.
* Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal. `I've got to` look at other sources.
- OK, actually most of our materials are available electronically now. You can access the psychology databases or electronical journals and articles through the library's computers, and if you want to search by titile, with word dream for example, just type it in and `then?` all the articls with dream in the title will `come up` on the screen.
* Cool, that's great! Too bad I cannot do this from home.
- But you can, all of the library's databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network.
* Really? I can't believe I didn't know that. It still `sounds like` it's going to `take a while` though, you know, `going through` all of that information and all of those sources.
- Maybe but you already narrow the search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn't be too bad. And you probaly notice that there's an abstract and summary `at the top of` the first page of the article you copied.
- When you go into the databases and eletronic sources, you have the option to display the abstract on the computer screen, skimming to those to decide `wether or not` you want to read the whole articles should `cut down` some time.
* Right, abstracts! They will `definately` make the project more doable. I guess I should `try out` the electronic search while I'm still here then, you know, `just in case`.
- Sure, that compuer's free over there, and I will be here till five this afternoon.
* Thanks, I feel a lot better about this assignment now.
