# Conversation 2
* Hi Mathew, I'm glad you can `come in` today. You've been observing Mr. Grable's third-grade class for your `approches to` education paper, right?
- Hmm, yes. I go over the Johnson Elementary School, you know, to watch Mr. Grable teach the children in class. It's been amazing, I mean, I'm just learning so much from just watching him. I'm so glad that the classroom observation are a requirement for a education program. I mean it's like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher.
* Well I'm glad to see you feel that way, Mathew. You know, that's the goal. So, I've been `reading over` your observation notes and I'm quite interested in `what's going on` in particular what's the astronomy unit he's been teaching.
- The astronomy unit?
* It seems that Mr. Grable has mastered the `interdisciplinary` approch to teaching, the way we've been talking about in the class.
- Oh, OK. Yeah, so like when he was teaching them astronomy? He didn't just teach them the name of the planets, he used it as a way to teach them `mythology`.
* Really? So how did he do that?
- Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they did't know that the name had any meaning, the stories behind them.
* So he
- He introduced the Greek and Roman mythology as a way of explaning. Like, you know, how like `Jupiter`'s biggest planet, right, and how Jupiter was the name the king of the gods in Roman mythology, right? So since Jupiter, the planet, is the largest planet in solar system, it's like the king of planet, like Jupiter was the king of all the gods.
* Oh, Mathew, that's a great example.
- Yeah. And each stdudent chose a planet and then did reserch on it to write a report and make a presentation. They went to the libary to do the research and then they made the presentation about the planet they chose.
* So in one science unit, in which the focus was astronomy, the students also learned about the literal of Greek and Roman mythology, used research skill in library, wrote a report and practiced their oral presentation skill.
- Exactly! He used this one topic to teach third-grades all that stuff. How do you use these books in the library, to write reports and even how to speak in public. Plus they had great time doing it.
* You know, Mathew, this is just what we've been talking about in the class. I'sure everyone could learn something from your experience. You know, Mathew, I'd love you to talk about this astronomy unit in class on Wednesday.
- Really? Hmmm, cause I don't really think I'll have any time to write my paper `by then`.
* Oh You won't need to write anything new just yet. For wednesday, use the class observation notes and explain the things we've discussed today.
- OK, that sounds all right.
